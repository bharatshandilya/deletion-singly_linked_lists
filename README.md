# deletion-singly_linked_lists
This repository contains c programs demonstrating basic linked lists operations. Each file focuses on a different deletion technique using a singly linked list.

---

## Files

- **traverseList.c** → Traverses and prints all elements of the linked list.  
- **deleteFirstNode.c** → Deletes the first node of the list.  
- **deleteLastNode.c** → Deletes the last node of the list.  
- **deleteAtIndex.c** → Deletes a node at a given index/position.  
- **deleteByValue.c** → Deletes a node by its value.  
- **combined.c** → Contains all delete functions together.

---

## Compilation & Execution

Use GCC (or any C compiler). Example:

gcc deleteFirstNode.c -o deleteFirstNode
./deleteFirstNode

For other files, replace the filename accordingly. Example for combined:

gcc combined.c -o combined
./combined
